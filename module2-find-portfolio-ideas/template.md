# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
- Public transportation
- Hiking

What do you know about?
- My background is in molecular biology, cancer research, data analysis.

What decisions do you face?
- I need to decide what I want to focus on.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
- Mapping transportation/ridership patterns for commuters in CDMX by time-of-day.
- Most popular hiking trails in Utah.

2. Trend related to the news
- https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexico-city-initiates-strategy-to-counter-metro-kidnapping-attempts/
-https://fox13now.com/2019/07/31/wellness-wednesday-intermountain-health-hub-app/

3. Who does that?
- who rides the metro in CDMX? workers going to work? children going to school? women vs. men? in CDMX, there are "women only" trains to combat harrasment; do they work? does this encourage more women to ride the train?
- are only healthy people going on hikes?

4. Answering a question people care about
- how far are the average commute times for CDMX citizens? what public health content to most riders find interesting or relevant on the Metrobus? content on contraceptives?
- which are the most strenuous hikes (i.e. that, on average, increase hiker's heart rates the most from baseline?

5. Valuable to businesses
- if (the public health)content televised on the Metrobus is more interesting, could this increase ridership? and thus, revenue for CDMX's public transportation system?
- overused hiking trails should charge a fee for additional upkeep and maintenance?

6. What's the most popular?
- Busiest metro stations at rushhour?
- Busiest hikes in Big Cottonwood Canyon? Little Cottonwood Canyon?

7. Cost/Money rankings
- Best cost-effective location for construction of new subway station? City government has a large budget for this.
- Highly-rated hikes by distance to/from Salt Lake City?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- No one rides the Metro in CDMX or it's extremely unsafe to ride the Metro in CDMX.
- There's no way to monetize going on hikes/using public spaces/going outdoors.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- Bikeshare data analysis. The movement of people is fascinating to me. Whether on bikeshares, buses, or trains...how millions of people move from one side of the city, per se, to another en masse every day, inspires me.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- Where are people commuting to and from? And at what times during the day? My hypothesis is that the working classes commute from the barrios in the outskirts of the city into the affluent communities of the city-center.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- Bikeshare data analysis in CDMX. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- e-scootershare data analysis.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
- The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) for CDMX is available. Also, AllTrails has an api.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
